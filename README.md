Simple currency conversion tool

Notes:

- IMPORTANT normally we should add file .env to .gitignore but in this recruitment task I left it on purpose
- there are no real styles, just center the content

Possible things to add in the future or upgrade the existing ones:

- creating user-friendly views (home page, error page, loading spinner)
- for a larger application, a style library (MaterialUI or tailwind) or create some design system
- improve the unit tests (I didn't mock the data)
- e2e tests
- maybe add redux if the application grew a lot
- maybe add a translation library (i18next?)
- add accessibility (using MaterialUI for components will help)
- add validation for input field
- add third party libraries (react-query, react-hook-form)
